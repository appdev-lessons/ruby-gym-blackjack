# Ruby Gym: BlackJack

Write a program to play a variety of BlackJack. (In our version, the numbers can be between 1 and 13.)

The program ingests an array of `numbers`, and it should print their sum.

Here's the catch: 
 
- If the sum is greater than 21, return 0, unless one of the numbers is 11. 
- In such a case, the 11 should be 'converted' to a 1 to prevent the sum from being exceeded.

For example, given 11 and 13 as input, the 11 should be 'converted' into a 1 so the total sum printed will be 14.

Use the `numbers` array below to write your solution. Your code should always start by extracting from the `numbers` array.

Hint: It may be helpful to use the `.include?` method on the array; [see the Ruby reference](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#include-array)

```ruby
numbers = [rand(1..13), rand(1..13)]
pp numbers
# write your program below
```
